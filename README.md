# pomodoro_timer

My take on [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
Writing a count down timer in React or Vanilla JS would be way too easy.
So I guess I will add some visual flair with canvas.

For practice I will write it with [React](https://pl.reactjs.org/) and [TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Caveats

**The timer is not super precise due to JS (pseudo)asynchronicity some lags are to be expected especially in a long run**

## App online
